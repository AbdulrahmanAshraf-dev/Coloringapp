# Coloring App
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/AbdulrahmanAshraf-dev/Coloringapp)

This repository contains a starter Flutter application. It serves as a basic template demonstrating the fundamental structure of a cross-platform mobile app built with the Flutter framework. The app features the default counter functionality provided by Flutter's new project setup.

## Features

*   **Cross-Platform:** Runs on both Android and iOS from a single codebase.
*   **Stateful Widget:** Implements a stateful widget (`MyHomePage`) to manage the application's interactive state.
*   **Simple UI:** A clean user interface built with standard Material Design widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `FloatingActionButton`.
*   **Counter Functionality:** A floating action button increments a counter, and the new value is displayed on the screen, demonstrating state changes with `setState`.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. For installation instructions, refer to the [official Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

### Installation & Running

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/abdulrahmanashraf-dev/coloringapp.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd coloringapp
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```
4.  Run the application on a connected device or emulator:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard Flutter directory structure:

*   `lib/main.dart`: The main entry point of the application, containing the app's root widget and home page.
*   `android/`: Contains Android-specific build files and configurations.
*   `ios/`: Contains iOS-specific build files and configurations.
*   `test/`: Includes a basic widget test that verifies the counter's increment functionality.
*   `pubspec.yaml`: The project's configuration file, which manages dependencies, fonts, and assets.
